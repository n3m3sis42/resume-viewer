In addition to experience in Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React, and Redux, I have over a decade of background in functional MUMPS-based programming, management, and software testing. I have a proven ability to master new technologies and solve difficult problems, and once learned an unfamiliar coding language with only a binder of handwritten notes as a teaching tool. In my free time, I'm co-writing an urban fantasy series and attending as many tech industry meetups as possible.",

## Resume Viewer

(to see the live site in action, go [here](http://sarah-g-evans-resume-viewer.herokuapp.com/ "Resume Viewer"))

This app allows you to build a site for your resume and professional portfolio. To get started, fork this repository and add your personal data into the public/resumeData.json file. At present, you will need to edit the Recommendations component and manually paste in your recommendations, although I intend to update the codebase later to allow the flexslider to populate the slides from the JSON file. 

### Customizing Images and Icons:
* You can add a custom header image by saving your own image file to /public/images as header-background.jpg.
* Add your portfolio screenshots to the /public/images/portfolio folder. 
* Additional social network icons are available - check out icons available in /public/css/font-awesome/scss/_icons.css.

#### Technologies used: 

* JavaScript
* React.js
* CeeVee template from Styleshout.com, modified with custom CSS.
